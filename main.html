            At the primary and secondary level, India has a large private school system complementing the government run schools, with 29% of students receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group.[9] Certain post-secondary technical schools are also private.
            The private education market in India had a revenue of US$450 million in 2008, but is projected to be a US$40 billion market.</p>

        <h1>Transforming India</h1>
        <p> In the 2011 Census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for males and 65% for females. This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%. India's improved education system
            is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.Much of the progress, especially in higher education and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions. While enrollment in higher education
            has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a gross enrollment ratio of 24% in 20 there still remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education enrolment levels of developed nations, a challenge that will be necessary
            to overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's comparatively young population.

            Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided
            as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Unlike other countries Private Schools are more common among middle class families.</p>

        <h1>Schools in India</h1>
        <p> In January 2019, India had over 900 universities and 40,000 colleges.[16] In India's higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged Scheduled Castes and
            Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. In universities, colleges, and similar institutions affiliated to the federal government, there is a maximum 50% of reservations applicable to these disadvantaged groups, at the state level it can
            vary. Maharashtra had 73% reservation in 2014, which is the highest percentage of reservations in India.</p>
